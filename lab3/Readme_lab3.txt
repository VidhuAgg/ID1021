The lab 3 contains of few files and functions taken from the course literature.
Namely BST,SequentialST,Qeueu,SeperateChainingHashST are all taken from the course literature and modified.
SequentialST is the book implementation of ST and is used to facilitate seperate chaining ST from the book.
The computings and time calculations are based on an M1 chip computer and may vary device to device.
All code from the literature which has actively been used is also comented out for ease and understanding of the implementation.
There is extensive use of reading file which has an absolute path and may need to be changed to run on other devices.
