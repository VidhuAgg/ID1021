The assignments are done with the aid of the course literature and many files have been taken from the book namely : 
Bag,DepthFirstPaths,Graph,ST,Stack,BreadthFirstPaths
ST implementation is based on book and not mine as it is much faster and utilises TreeMap with a Red/Black tree.
All the files have been modified myself for the assignments and have been commented only after understanding the functions.
Some functions have not been used but kept intact from the book for debugging purposes.
Alot of code has been reused among assignments due to the similarites in them however apt comments have been made.
In the give data file the following change was made only to test Assignment 5:
WV AL
